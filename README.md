# Brass Trainer
Brass Trainer is an educational mobile game intended for players of brass instruments to practice fingerings and sight reading.
### How to play
The numbered buttons represent the keys of the instrument. Pressing the Air button blows the horn. After the game starts, notes written in musical notation will appear. The objective is to press the appropriate buttons that would sound these notes on a real life instrument. Accuracy and speed is rewarded with a high score.
### Game features:
- Choose your instrument: Trumpet, French Horn, Euphonium or Tuba.
- Practice reading in different clefs, transpositions and key signatures.
- Increase the difficulty with random accidentals and extreme range.
- Keep your high scores.
